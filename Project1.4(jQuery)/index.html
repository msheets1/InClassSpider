				<h2>SO WHAT EXACTLY IS ANGULAR?</h2>
				<p>Per our friend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS" class="accents" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
				, "AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework maintained by Google, 
				that assists in running single-page applications".</p>
				<p>In lay terms, AngularJS, originally created by <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/misko-hevery-angularjs/" class="accents" target="_blank">Mi≈°ko Hevery</a>
				, is an open-source piece of code (new to open source?)
				that makes it easier to develop web applications that are meant to feel more like
				traditional desktop or mobile applications, instead of like the clunky web pages of bygone eras.</p>
				<p>In addition, AngularJS attempts to provide a client-side MVC framework for managing data on the fly.
				This makes it easy to have quick turnaround with inputs on forms--without even touching the server,
				users can keep getting work done and dynamic updates can happen instantly</p>

				<h2><span>ANGULAR DIRECTIVES</span></h2>
				<p>In order to effect its powers on native HTML elements, AngularJS makes use of "Directives".</p>
				<p>I've listed below the directives used in my <a href="angular.html" class="accents">examples</a>
				to give a little more explanation. Though these directives are used as part of native HTML, they
				are paired with a matching JavaScript page that gives definition to their specific use in
				your application.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="accents2">ng-controller</span>: The ng-controller directive is used to create a scope
					and essentially a control center for a specified set of Angular Directives. Attached to the div
					that specifies of the scope you wish to work within, if you inspect the	JavaScript document where 
					the ng-controller is defined you will find a set of definitions of models and functions
					contained within it.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="accents2">ng-model</span>: Used in conjunction with an input, the ng-model directive
					grabs the value of the input and holds it in memory for use later on. The Name Databinding example
					shows a very clear example of how this is done to bind the value given to another element on the
					DOM.
				</p>	
				<p>
					<span class="accents2">ng-click</span>: ng-click does what its name suggest, effectively acting as
					an event handler when added to an element.
				</p>	
				<p>
					<span class="accents2">ng-submit</span>: ng-submit acts quite similarly to ng-click but (I believe) works to grab
					the contents of a form as its name suggests. This is shown in the use of the "add" button on the todo
					list example.
				</p>				
				<p>
					<span class="accents2">ng-repeat</span>: Use this for nifty little tricks where you want to quickly
					and dynamically generate any number of unique HTML elements. Definitely one of my favorite of things
					I've found about Angular so far, this is used for the tiles on the dance floor and for instantly creating
					new todo items to match the items latently resting in memory.
				</p>	
				<p>
					If you haven't already, now's a great time to check out the <a href="angular.html" class="accents">examples</a> and see Angular in action.
